# Drug-Use-and-High-school-education
Improvements in reducing drug usage and education at a government level


 Business Case


The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!



1. Analyze diverse datasets & explicitly state your assumptions.
2. Form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy.
3. Visualize and interpret your plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
